TITLE: `STMERLIN' : convenience wrapper for estimating a parametric and 
semi-parametric survival model with merlin, optionally including multiple 
timescales


DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: stmerlin fits survival models, including a range of 
parametric distributions, flexible spline-based models, and the Cox model, 
possibly including multiple timescales. It is a convenience wrapper of the 
more powerful merlin command, but with a much more user-friendly syntax. 
Time-dependent effects can be specified using restricted cubic splines 
through options, or in alternative ways using merlin's linear predictor 
syntax. For predictions available post-estimation, see stmerlin postestimation.
